**Introduction**  

- Unsupervised learning  
    
    Unsupervised learning is a kind of machine learning technology used to find patterns in data. The input data used by unsupervised learning algorithm are not labeled, which means that the data only gives the input variable (independent variable x) and does not give the corresponding output variable (dependent variable).
    
    There are many unsupervised learning algorithms. The commonly used ones are clustering algorithm, principal component analysis (PCA), anomaly detection, self encoder, deep belief network, Heb type learning, generative countermeasure network (GAN) and self-organizing mapping.
    
    The following is the algorithm we learned in this task:
    
1. K-means Clustering  
The idea of K-means Clustering algorithm is very simple. For a given sample set, the sample set is divided into K clusters according to the distance between samples. Let the points in the cluster be connected as closely as possible, and let the distance between clusters be as large as possible.


2. PCA model  
PCA (principal component analysis) is a common data analysis method, which is often used for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data and can be used to extract the main feature components of data.

**DataSet**  
The datasets included this lecture is:

- Wheat seed dataset:

  - Similar to iris dataset. The data set contains seed information belonging to three different wheat varieties: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, represented by 1, 2 and 3 respectively
