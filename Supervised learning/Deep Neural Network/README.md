**Introduction**  

Deep neural network (DNN) is a framework of deep learning. It is a neural network with at least one hidden layer. Similar to shallow neural network, deep neural network can also provide modeling for complex nonlinear systems, but the extra level provides a higher level of abstraction for the model, which improves the ability of the model.

**Tensorflow**  

In this task, we try to use scratch to implement deep neural network.

Tensorflow is a free open source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used for a series of tasks, but special attention is paid to the training and reasoning of deep neural networks.


**DataSet**  

The data used in this task is

- Fashion MNIST dataset:

  - It has the same structure as MNIST dataset, with a training set of 60000 samples and a test set of 10000 clothing images. The size of the image is also fixed to 28 Ã— 28. In this way, the preprocessed image data is reduced to the minimum level.
