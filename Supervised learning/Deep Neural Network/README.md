**Introduction**  

Deep neural network (DNN) is a framework of deep learning. It is a neural network with at least one hidden layer. Similar to shallow neural network, deep neural network can also provide modeling for complex nonlinear systems, but the extra level provides a higher level of abstraction for the model, which improves the ability of the model.




The data used in this task is

- Fashion MNIST dataset:

  - It has the same structure as MNIST dataset, with a training set of 60000 samples and a test set of 10000 clothing images. The size of the image is also fixed to 28 Ã— 28. In this way, the preprocessed image data is reduced to the minimum level.
