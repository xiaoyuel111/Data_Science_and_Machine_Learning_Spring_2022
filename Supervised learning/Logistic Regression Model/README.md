**Introduction**  

- Both logistic regression and linear regression are generalized linear models. Logistic regression assumes that dependent variable y obeys Bernoulli distribution, while linear regression assumes that dependent variable y obeys Gaussian distribution. 
- There are many similarities between logistic regression and linear regression. If the **sigmoid function** is removed, the logistic regression algorithm is a linear regression. It can be said that logistic regression is supported by linear regression theory, but logistic regression introduces nonlinear factors through sigmoid function, so it can easily deal with the 0 / 1 classification problem.

**DataSet**  

The data used in structure 5 is

- Wheat seed dataset:

  - Similar to iris dataset. The data set contains seed information belonging to three different wheat varieties: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, represented by 1, 2 and 3 respectively
